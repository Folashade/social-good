For this week:

On mobile: Make sure you can go through the menus, and see the game. Need not be able to slash


Hook *everything* up
All buttons should exist work (Can maybe fake it for this deadline - 
  so maybe all teacher or content buttons can do the same thing)

Question balloons. Need a class for them/inheritance. Need to implement questions UI and AJAX.

Game should work. Doesn't have to be polished, but should work. 

Should at least be completely done on Desktop
OR
Start mobile, be playable.

Use Evan's onTap() for touch+mouse. On his todo list
libs/jq folder on his github (es92)


Final week:
For different screens: Show and hide different divs when onClick handler.
AJAX the images, don't load everything.

One large spritesheet? Also add a loading screen then.
Once document.ready, AJAX request for the large spritesheet and display loading screen.
